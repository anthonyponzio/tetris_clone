## About The Project
> Growing up in the age of Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, Tetris was a game everyone in my family used to enjoy playing. I wanted to learn more about HTML5 canvas manipulation through JavaScript and I figured no better way to accomplish that than through making a loved childhood game.
###### I really enjoyed building this project and all the headaches I encountered along the way. All told this was a 3 day project with a lot of breaks and a lot of time spent sketching out my thoughts and ideas.
###### There are a lot of fun functions throughout this small game, with lots of quirky array manipulation and value swapping. I encourage you to have a read of my code, and by all means clone and make your own changes, or make your very own version of this classic game.
